# rtree
A Rust based r*-tree implementation.

An R-tree is a datastructure that allows efficient spatial access queries like nearest-neighbor or point lookup queries.

This implementation is purely written in rust, uses the r*-tree (r-star-tree) variant for improved query performance and works with 2, 3 and 4 dimensional data.

See the documentation for more information, also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) gives a nice introduction.
